# turtle-crossing

A simple game of a turtle trying to cross the road.
You have to avoid being hit by a car during the process.
First you are asked to choose a difficulty:

- easy, ~1 car per 0.6 second
- medium, ~1 car per 0.3 second
- hard, ~1 car per 0.2 second
- manic, ~2 cars per 0.3 second

Once you set the difficulty, the game begins. You get to
the next level by making it to the other side of the road 
by pressing the up button. First the cars go slow, but they 
get progressively faster the higher level you get to. The 
game ends when you get hit by a car.
